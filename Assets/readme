Go to start menu and start the game. There will be a popup to enter the username if the player has never registered before. Once registered that username will be displayed on the leaderboard if on the top. 

then you can play the game. Once all the levels are completed the time will be recorded and sent to the leaderboard database. If lost in between then that particular level should restart previous points won't be affected.
